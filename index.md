Hi there! My name is Yair, as the bioinformatics lead of Prof Jacob Moran-Gilad's "Microbiology, Advanced Genomics and Infection Control Applications Laboratory" (https://morangiladlab.com) I am responsible for all computing requirements of the lab, including research and technical applications. 

- For research, I am involved in a variety of projects and collaborations covering the three major branches of microbial NGS, namely shotgun metagenomics, targeted metagenomics and whole genome sequencing.
- For technical aspects, I manage the storage of lab data, use of computers and workstations that are used by lab members.
