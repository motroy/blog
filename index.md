title: Welcome to my blog
---

Hi there! My name is Yair, as the bioinformatics lead of Prof Jacob Moran-Gilad's "Microbiology, Advanced Genomics and Infection Control Applications Laboratory" (https://morangiladlab.com) I am responsible for all computing requirements of the lab, including research and technical applications. 

- For research, I am involved in a variety of projects and collaborations covering the three major branches of microbial NGS, namely shotgun metagenomics, targeted metagenomics and whole genome sequencing.
- For technical aspects, I manage the storage of lab data, use of computers and workstations that are used by lab members.

This blog is intended to share ideas, experience and provide some examples for future me :), future lab members and future students. It also serves as a playground for odd experiments that I have ventured, and as did Ryan Wick for his blog (https://rrwick.github.io/about/) I plan to also __"produce a DOI for each blog post using Zenodo, so you can cite them if you use them in your research"__ :)
